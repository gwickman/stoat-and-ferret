# Impact Assessment Table: v011

| # | Area | Description | Classification | Resulting Work Item | Caused By |
|---|------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1 | docs/design/08-gui-architecture.md | Project Manager Panel section shows read-only clip list (lines 219-239); no add/edit/delete controls documented. Component checklist (line 550) shows "Add basic clip list display" incomplete but no clip CRUD checklist item exists. | substantial | Add clip CRUD controls to GUI architecture spec (Project Manager section, component checklist, wireframe) | BL-075 |
| 2 | docs/C4-Documentation/c4-component-web-gui.md | Backend API Consumption (line 59) only lists `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/clips`. POST/PATCH/DELETE for clips are missing. Feature summary (line 20) says "clip timeline with timecode display" — no mention of clip management controls. | small | Add clip POST/PATCH/DELETE endpoints to C4 component API consumption section | BL-075 |
| 3 | docs/C4-Documentation/c4-code-gui-components.md | ProjectDetails.tsx documented as read-only display (clip-position, clip-in, clip-out, clip-duration test IDs only). No add/edit/delete components or callbacks documented. | small | Update ProjectDetails documentation and add new clip form/modal component entries | BL-075 |
| 4 | caller-impact | Frontend has zero callers of clip write endpoints. `gui/src/hooks/useProjects.ts` only exports `fetchClips()` — no `createClip()`, `updateClip()`, or `deleteClip()` functions exist. Backend POST/PATCH/DELETE endpoints at `/api/v1/projects/{id}/clips` are fully implemented and tested but completely unwired in the GUI. | substantial | Implement clip mutation API client functions (createClip, updateClip, deleteClip) in useProjects.ts and wire to new UI controls | BL-075 |
| 5 | docs/manual/06_gui-guide.md | "Managing Clips" section (lines 107-115) already documents add/update/remove operations as if implemented, but no GUI code exists for these operations. Documentation is aspirational — will become accurate once BL-075 is implemented. No update needed if BL-075 ships as described. | small | Verify GUI guide accuracy after BL-075 implementation; update if final UX differs from current description | BL-075 |
| 6 | docs/design/01-roadmap.md | Milestone 1.12 (lines 144-149) lists "project details view with clip list" but no milestone covers clip CRUD GUI controls. Phase 1 deliverables (line 176) mention "basic clip management" without specifying add/edit/delete. | small | Add clip CRUD GUI to roadmap milestone checklist or mark as delivered post-implementation | BL-075 |
| 7 | docs/manual/06_gui-guide.md | "Scanning for Videos" section (lines 62-70) documents text-entry-only path input: "Enter the directory path containing your video files". No mention of a browse/folder-picker mechanism. | small | Update scanning section to document Browse button alongside manual path entry after BL-070 implementation | BL-070 |
| 8 | docs/design/08-gui-architecture.md | ScanModal component listed in component inventory (line 671 area) but architecture does not describe a folder selection mechanism or backend directory listing API. If BL-070 requires a backend endpoint for directory browsing, the architecture needs updating. | small | Update GUI architecture ScanModal description to include browse/folder-picker mechanism once approach is decided | BL-070 |
| 9 | docs/design/05-api-specification.md | No directory browsing/listing endpoint exists in the API spec. If BL-070 uses a backend-assisted approach (likely, since browser File System Access API has limited support), a new endpoint is needed. | substantial | Evaluate whether BL-070 requires a new backend directory listing API endpoint; if yes, add to API spec as part of the feature | BL-070 |
| 10 | docs/manual/01_getting-started.md | Line 32 mentions `.env` file support but no .env.example reference exists. States "See API Overview for the full settings reference" — should also reference .env.example once created. | small | Add .env.example reference to getting-started guide as part of BL-071 | BL-071 |
| 11 | docs/setup/02_development-setup.md | Development setup does not mention copying or creating a .env file from a template. New developers must discover env vars from source code. | small | Add "copy .env.example to .env" step to development setup guide as part of BL-071 | BL-071 |
| 12 | docs/setup/04_configuration.md | Comprehensive env var docs already exist (9 variables documented). .env.example must mirror this file. Settings class in settings.py has 10 fields (includes log_backup_count and log_max_bytes not in config docs). | small | Cross-check .env.example against both config docs and Settings class; ensure all 10 variables from settings.py are included | BL-071 |
| 13 | AGENTS.md | No Windows-specific guidance section exists. Commands section (lines 19-46) shows only Unix commands without platform notes. | small | Add "Windows (Git Bash)" section with /dev/null guidance — this is the primary deliverable of BL-019 | BL-019 |
| 14 | caller-impact | BL-076 creates docs/auto-dev/IMPACT_ASSESSMENT.md as a new file consumed by the auto-dev design phase (Task 003). No existing callers to update — the file does not exist yet. The auto-dev framework already handles the "file not found" case gracefully. | small | No caller adoption risk — new file with existing consumer pathway | BL-076 |
