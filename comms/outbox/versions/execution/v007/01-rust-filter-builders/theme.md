# Theme 01: rust-filter-builders

## Description

Implement Rust filter builders for audio mixing and video transitions, extending the proven v006 builder pattern (LRN-028) to two new effect domains. These builders provide the type-safe foundation that the effect registry and GUI consume.

## Features
