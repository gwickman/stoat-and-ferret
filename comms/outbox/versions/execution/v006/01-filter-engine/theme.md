# Theme 01: filter-engine

## Description

Build the foundational Rust filter infrastructure — expression type system, filter graph validation, and composition API. These are the building blocks that all downstream filter builders and API endpoints depend on. Corresponds to M2.1 (Filter Expression Engine). Per LRN-019, infrastructure-first sequencing eliminates rework.

## Features

- **001-expression-engine**
