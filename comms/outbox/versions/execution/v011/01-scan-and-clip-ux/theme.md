# Theme 01: scan-and-clip-ux

## Description

Deliver the missing GUI interaction layer for media scanning and clip management. The browse button (BL-070) validates the full-stack GUI pipeline by adding a new backend endpoint and frontend component, while clip CRUD (BL-075) wires the frontend to existing backend endpoints — closing a gap deferred since v005.
