# Quality Gaps: 002-rust-workspace

## No Critical Gaps

All acceptance criteria have been met and all quality gates pass.

## Minor Notes

### Type Stubs
The type stubs in `stubs/stoat_ferret_core/` were created manually rather than generated by `pyo3-stub-gen`. This is functional but may need to be regenerated if the Rust API changes significantly.

### Build Backend
The `pyproject.toml` currently uses `hatchling` as the build backend for pure Python builds, with maturin configuration available for when the Rust extension needs to be built. This allows the package to be installed in Python-only mode when Rust tooling is not available.

## Resolved Issues

The previous build environment issue (Git Bash's `link.exe` shadowing MSVC's linker) has been resolved. The Rust toolchain now compiles correctly with:
- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` passing
- `cargo test` passing
- `maturin develop` building and installing the extension
