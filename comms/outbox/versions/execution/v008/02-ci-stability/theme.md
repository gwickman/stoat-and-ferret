# Theme 02: ci-stability

## Description

Eliminate the flaky E2E test that intermittently blocks CI merges, restoring reliable CI signal for all future development. During v007 execution, this flake caused a false-positive halt on the dynamic-parameter-forms feature despite all acceptance criteria passing.

## Features

- **001-flaky-e2e-fix**

## Live Progress

For current per-feature execution status, see `version-state.json` in the version outbox directory.
