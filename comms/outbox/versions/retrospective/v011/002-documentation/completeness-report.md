## Notes

- The task prompt references `comms/state/version-state.json` but this project stores version execution state per-execution in `comms/state/version-executions/`. The v011 execution state file exists and contains the correct version identifier and completed status.
- All 5 features across both themes have completion reports with status "complete".
- Both theme retrospectives and the version retrospective are present.
- The CHANGELOG contains a full v011 section dated 2026-02-24 with Added, Changed, and Fixed subsections.
