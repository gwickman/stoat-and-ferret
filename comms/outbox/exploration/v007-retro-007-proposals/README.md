# Exploration: v007-retro-007-proposals

Compiled all findings from v007 retrospective tasks 001-006 (including 004b) into a proposals document using Crystal Clear Actions format.

## What Was Produced

- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v007/007-proposals/proposals.md` — Complete proposals document with all findings, actions, and references
- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v007/007-proposals/README.md` — Summary with status-by-task table, immediate fixes, backlog references, and statistics

## Key Results

- **3 findings** across 7 tasks
- **1 immediate fix**: Delete 2 stale local branches from descoped theme 3 features
- **6 already-tracked items**: BL-055, BL-054, BL-019, BL-053, PR-001, PR-002
- **0 new backlog items created**: All quality gates passed (no code problems); all findings already covered by existing items
- **0 user actions required**
- v007 was an exceptionally clean version — 884 tests passing, 100% documentation completeness, no architecture drift, 131/131 acceptance criteria met
