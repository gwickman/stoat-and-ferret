# Exploration: v010-retro-009-project

Completed project-specific closure evaluation for v010 retrospective. No VERSION_CLOSURE.md exists, so the evaluation was based on the version's actual changes (2 themes, 5 features covering async pipeline fix and job controls).

## Artifacts Produced

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Closure README | `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v010/009-project-closure/README.md` |

## Summary

Evaluated 8 closure areas (prompt templates, MCP tools, configuration schemas, shared utilities, new files/patterns, cross-project tooling, API specification, C4 documentation). No new project-specific closure needs were identified. All relevant technical debt is already tracked in existing backlog items (BL-069 for C4 docs, BL-079 for API spec examples, PR-004 for deferred WebSocket push).
