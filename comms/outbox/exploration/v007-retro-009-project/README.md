# Exploration: v007-retro-009-project

Project-specific closure evaluation for v007 (Effect Workshop GUI).

## What Was Produced

| Artifact | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Closure README | `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v007/009-project-closure/README.md` | Evaluation of 6 closure areas against v007's actual changes |

## Summary

Evaluated project-specific closure needs for v007 across 6 areas: prompt templates, MCP tools, configuration schemas, shared utilities, project indexes, and cross-project tooling. No VERSION_CLOSURE.md was present, so evaluation was based on the version's actual changes (4 themes, 11 features delivering the Effect Workshop GUI).

**Result:** No project-specific closure needs identified. v007 was self-contained application-level feature work. All documentation and plan updates were already handled by Task 008-closure.
