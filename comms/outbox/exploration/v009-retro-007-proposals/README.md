# Exploration: v009-retro-007-proposals

Compiled all findings from v009 retrospective tasks 001–006 (including 004b) into a proposals document using Crystal Clear Actions format.

## What Was Produced

- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v009/007-proposals/README.md` — Summary of proposals with status table
- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v009/007-proposals/proposals.md` — Full proposals document for remediation exploration

## Key Results

- **3 total findings** across 8 task areas (7 tasks + state integrity check)
- **1 immediate fix**: Create `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` top-level architecture overview
- **1 backlog item** (BL-069, from Task 005): Update C4 documentation for v009 changes
- **1 product request** (PR-003, from Task 004b): Investigate excessive context compaction
- **0 quality gate backlog items**: All checks passed cleanly
- **0 user actions required**
- **0 state file integrity issues**: All MCP-managed files modified only via proper tooling

v009 was a clean version — most retrospective tasks found no issues requiring remediation.
