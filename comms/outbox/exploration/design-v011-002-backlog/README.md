# Exploration: design-v011-002-backlog

Backlog analysis and retrospective review for v011 version design.

## What Was Produced

All artifacts saved to `comms/outbox/versions/design/v011/002-backlog/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| README.md | Summary of backlog scope, previous version, key learnings, and tech debt |
| backlog-details.md | Full details for all 5 backlog items with complexity assessments |
| retrospective-insights.md | Synthesized insights from v010 retrospectives |
| learnings-summary.md | 9 relevant learnings from the project learning repository |

## Key Findings

- **5 mandatory backlog items** fetched: BL-019, BL-070, BL-071, BL-075, BL-076
- **Priority mix:** 2x P1, 2x P2, 1x P3
- **Previous version:** v010 (completed 2026-02-24) — fixed P0 async blocking bug, added job controls
- **Quality refinement:** BL-019 updated with testable acceptance criteria (had none) and expanded description
- **9 learnings** identified as applicable, with LRN-031 (detailed design specs), LRN-032 (schema-driven architecture), and LRN-037 (independent stores) most directly relevant to v011's GUI features
