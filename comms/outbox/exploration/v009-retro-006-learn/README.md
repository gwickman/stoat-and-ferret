# Exploration: v009 Learning Extraction

Extracted 6 new learnings from v009 retrospective materials and saved them via the learnings system (LRN-047 through LRN-052). Identified 3 existing learnings reinforced by new evidence. Filtered out 6 candidates as duplicates, too implementation-specific, or version-specific.

## Outputs

- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v009/006-learnings/README.md` - Summary with new/reinforced/filtered tables
- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v009/006-learnings/learnings-detail.md` - Full content of all 6 saved learnings

## Sources Read

- 6 completion reports (3 per theme)
- 2 theme retrospectives (01-observability-pipeline, 02-gui-runtime-fixes)
- 1 version retrospective
- Task 004b session health findings (README.md, findings-detail.md)
- Session analytics: failed_sessions and errors queries (30-day window)
