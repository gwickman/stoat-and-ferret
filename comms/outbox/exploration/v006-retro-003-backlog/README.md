# Exploration: v006-retro-003-backlog

## Summary

Completed backlog verification for v006 (Effects Engine Foundation). Cross-referenced 7 planned backlog items (BL-037 through BL-043) from PLAN.md against feature requirements, checked their status, and completed all 7 which were still open. No orphaned items, no unplanned items, no issues.

## Artifacts Produced

- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v006/003-backlog/README.md` — Verification summary with hygiene observations
- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v006/003-backlog/backlog-report.md` — Detailed item-level report with cross-reference tables

## Key Findings

- All 7 v006 backlog items were in "open" status despite all features being completed
- Perfect concordance between PLAN.md and feature requirements (no unplanned items)
- 0 orphaned items found among 14 open backlog items
- 0 stale items (all open items < 25 days old)
- Size calibration: 6L + 1M, appropriate for a greenfield engine version
