# Exploration: v008-retro-003-backlog

## Summary

Backlog verification for v008 retrospective. Cross-referenced all BL-XXX items planned for v008 with their actual implementation status and completed 4 open backlog items.

## Artifacts Produced

| File | Location | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| README.md | `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v008/003-backlog/README.md` | Verification summary with hygiene observations |
| backlog-report.md | `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v008/003-backlog/backlog-report.md` | Detailed item-by-item status table |

## Key Findings

- **4 items verified:** BL-055, BL-056, BL-058, BL-062
- **4 items completed** by this task (all were still open)
- **0 unplanned items** — requirements.md matched PLAN.md exactly
- **0 orphaned items** — no open items reference v008
- **0 stale items** — all open items are under 17 days old
- **Size calibration:** v008 items tended toward over-estimation, particularly BL-055 (sized L, actual S)
