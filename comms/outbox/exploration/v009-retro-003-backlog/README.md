# Exploration: v009-retro-003-backlog

## Summary

Completed backlog verification for v009 (Observability & GUI Runtime). Cross-referenced 6 planned backlog items from PLAN.md against feature requirements, verified their status, and completed all 6 open items.

## Artifacts Produced

All outputs saved to `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v009/003-backlog/`:

- **README.md** — Verification summary with items verified, completed, orphaned items check, and hygiene observations (staleness, tag consistency, size calibration)
- **backlog-report.md** — Detailed table of all 6 items with source cross-reference, planned status, before/after status, and actions taken

## Key Findings

- All 6 v009 backlog items (BL-057, BL-059, BL-060, BL-063, BL-064, BL-065) were still open despite features being complete
- All 6 successfully completed by this task with version/theme linkage
- 100% alignment between PLAN.md and requirements.md — no unplanned items
- No orphaned items referencing v009
- No stale backlog items (all open items < 17 days old)
- 67 orphaned tags (expected — version-specific tags from completed items)
- All v009 items uniformly sized as L (appropriate for scope)
