# Exploration: v010-retro-007-proposals

Compiled all findings from v010 retrospective tasks 001–006 (including 004b) into a proposals document using Crystal Clear Actions format.

## What Was Produced

- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v010/007-proposals/README.md` — Summary of findings by task with reference tables

## Key Results

- **7 tasks reviewed**, 4 findings identified
- **0 immediate fixes** — no remediation needed for next exploration
- **0 new backlog items** — no quality gate code problems found
- **1 new product request created**: PR-004 (WebSocket/SSE real-time progress push, P3) — surfaced from deferred work in v010 completion reports
- **2 existing backlog items referenced**: BL-069 (C4 docs, P2), BL-079 (API spec examples, P3)

## Summary

v010 was a clean version. All quality gates pass, all documentation is present, environment was clean, all backlog items completed, and all findings from session health and architecture analysis are already tracked in existing items. The only new action was creating PR-004 to capture a deferred enhancement from the job-controls completion reports.
