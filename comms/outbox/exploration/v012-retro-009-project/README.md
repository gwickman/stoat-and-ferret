## Summary

Evaluated 9 closure areas against v012's actual changes (removal of 11 unused PyO3 bindings, addition of transition GUI tab, API doc corrections). No project-specific closure needs were identified — all documentation, stubs, and design doc updates were completed within the feature PRs. No `VERSION_CLOSURE.md` was present, so no checklist execution was required.
