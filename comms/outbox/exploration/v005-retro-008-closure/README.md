# v005 Closure Report

4 items completed, 1 document updated. v005 is now fully closed.

## Plan.md
**Updated.** Changes made:
- Marked v005 as `✅ complete` in version table
- Updated Current Focus from v005 to v006
- Moved v005 from Planned Versions to Completed Versions with full summary
- Marked EXP-003 and BL-028 investigations as complete
- Added change log entry for v005 completion

## CHANGELOG
**Verified complete.** The v005 section has date (2026-02-09), categorized entries (Added, Changed, Fixed), and all 4 themes (frontend-foundation, backend-services, gui-components, e2e-testing) with 11 features are accurately represented. No changes needed.

## README
**No changes needed.** The project description ("AI-driven video editor with hybrid Python/Rust architecture - not production ready") remains accurate. The README is intentionally minimal; project details live in AGENTS.md and design docs.

## Repository
**Clean.** No open PRs, no stale branches (only `main` exists locally and remotely), no unmerged branches. Working tree clean except for the expected exploration state JSON file.
