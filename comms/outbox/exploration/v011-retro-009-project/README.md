| Closure evaluation README | `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v011/009-project-closure/README.md` | Full evaluation of 6 closure areas against v011's actual changes |

## Summary

Evaluated v011 (GUI Usability & Developer Experience — 5 features, 2 themes) for project-specific closure needs across 6 areas: prompt template cross-references, MCP tool documentation, configuration schema changes, shared utility changes, project index updates, and cross-project tooling. All areas were clean — no closure actions required. `VERSION_CLOSURE.md` was absent; evaluation was based on the version's actual changes.
