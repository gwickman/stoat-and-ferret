# Exploration: v007-retro-001-env

Environment verification for the v007 retrospective.

## What Was Produced

Verified that the environment is ready for retrospective execution by checking:
- MCP server health (healthy, v6.0.0)
- Git status (on main, synced with remote)
- Open PRs (none)
- Version execution status (v007 completed, 9/11 features)
- Branch state (2 stale local branches from theme 3)

## Output Artifacts

All artifacts saved to `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v007/001-environment/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `README.md` | Environment status summary with findings per check |
| `environment-report.md` | Detailed report with raw outputs from all checks |

## Result

**READY** — No blockers. Theme 3's partial completion (2/4 features) and 2 stale branches are noted for retrospective investigation.
