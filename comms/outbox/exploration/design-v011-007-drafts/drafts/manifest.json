    "constraints": [
      "v010 must be deployed (completed 2026-02-23)",
      "No inter-theme dependencies — themes can execute in parallel",
      "Backend clip CRUD endpoints already exist — BL-075 is frontend-only",

      "Empty allowed_scan_roots means all directories permitted (confirmed by LRN-017)",
