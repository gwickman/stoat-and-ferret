# Exploration: v010-retro-003-backlog

Backlog verification for v010 retrospective. Cross-referenced PLAN.md and feature requirements with backlog item status, completed all 5 open items that were implemented in v010.

## What Was Produced

Artifacts saved to `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v010/003-backlog/`:

- **README.md** - Verification summary with items verified, completed, orphaned items check, and hygiene observations (staleness, tag consistency, size calibration)
- **backlog-report.md** - Detailed table of all 5 backlog items with before/after status

## Key Findings

- **5/5 items completed**: BL-072, BL-073, BL-074, BL-077, BL-078 were all still open and marked complete
- **0 unplanned items**: All requirements.md BL references matched PLAN.md exactly
- **0 orphaned items**: No open items reference v010 outside of planned features
- **0 stale items**: All 11 remaining open items are < 90 days old
- **Size calibration note**: BL-077 (L) was over-estimated (actual ~S/M); BL-074 (M) may have been under-estimated (actual ~L)
