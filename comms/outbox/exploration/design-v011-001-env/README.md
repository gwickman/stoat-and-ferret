# Exploration: design-v011-001-env

Environment verification and context gathering for v011 version design.

## What Was Produced

Artifacts saved to `comms/outbox/versions/design/v011/001-environment/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| README.md | Summary of environment status (ready) and key context |
| environment-checks.md | Detailed results from health, project, git, and C4 checks |
| version-context.md | v011 scope from PLAN.md: goals, themes, backlog IDs, constraints |

## Key Findings

- **Environment:** Ready. MCP server healthy (v6.0.0), all services OK, git/gh available.
- **Project:** 30 themes completed across 10 versions, no active work.
- **Git:** On main, in sync with remote, effectively clean working tree.
- **C4 Docs:** Comprehensive (55 files) but 2 versions behind (last updated v008).
- **v011 Scope:** 2 themes, 5 features, 5 backlog items. GUI usability + developer onboarding.
