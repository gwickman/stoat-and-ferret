# Exploration: v009-retro-009-project

Project-specific closure evaluation for stoat-and-ferret version v009.

## What Was Produced

- **`comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v009/009-project-closure/README.md`** — Full closure evaluation report

## Summary

Evaluated v009's 2 themes (6 features) for project-specific closure needs. v009 wired observability components (FFmpeg metrics, audit logging, file logging) into the DI chain and fixed GUI runtime gaps (SPA routing, pagination, WebSocket broadcasts).

No VERSION_CLOSURE.md was found, so evaluation was based on actual version changes. No project-specific closure needs were identified — all changes are internal application features with no impact on process documentation, MCP tools, prompt templates, or cross-project tooling.

The only tracked gap is BL-069 (C4 architecture documentation update), which was already created by a prior retrospective task.
