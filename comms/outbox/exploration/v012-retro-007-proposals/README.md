# Exploration: v012-retro-007-proposals

Synthesized findings from v012 retrospective tasks 001-006 (including 004b) into a proposals document. v012 is clean — 10 findings total, 0 immediate fixes needed, 0 new backlog items created, 1 user action (size calibration process improvement). All quality gates passed, all documentation present, architecture drift already tracked in BL-069/PR-007, session health findings covered by existing product requests.
