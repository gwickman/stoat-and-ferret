# Exploration: v012-retro-006-learn

Learning extraction for v012 retrospective. Analyzed 5 completion reports, 2 theme retrospectives, 1 version retrospective, session health findings (004b), architecture alignment (005), backlog verification (003), quality gates report (004), and session analytics (failed_sessions + errors queries over 30 days).

## Produced

- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v012/006-learnings/README.md` — Summary with new learnings table, reinforced learnings, and filtered-out items
- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v012/006-learnings/learnings-detail.md` — Full content of all 5 saved learnings
- 5 learnings saved via `save_learning`: LRN-063 through LRN-067

## Results

- **5 new learnings saved** (LRN-063 to LRN-067)
- **4 existing learnings reinforced** (LRN-061, LRN-029, LRN-039, LRN-038)
- **12 items filtered out** (too specific, already covered, version-specific, insufficient evidence)
- **0 session-sourced new learnings** (all session patterns already captured by existing learnings or product requests)
