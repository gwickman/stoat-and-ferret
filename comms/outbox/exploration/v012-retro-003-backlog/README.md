# Exploration: v012-retro-003-backlog

Backlog verification for v012 retrospective. Cross-referenced planned backlog items with actual status and completed all open items.

## What Was Produced

### `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v012/003-backlog/`

- **README.md** — Verification summary with items verified, completed, orphan check, hygiene observations (staleness, tag consistency, size calibration)
- **backlog-report.md** — Detailed item-level table showing each BL-XXX reference, its source, status before/after, and action taken

## Key Results

- **5 items completed:** BL-061, BL-066, BL-067, BL-068, BL-079 (all planned v012 items)
- **0 already complete:** All items were still open
- **0 orphaned items:** No open items reference v012 unexpectedly
- **0 unplanned items:** All requirement references matched PLAN.md
- **1 open item remaining:** BL-069 (C4 docs, explicitly excluded from v012)
- **Backlog health:** Clean — no stale items, no issues
