# Theme 2: Timeline Math\n\n## Overview\nImplement pure Rust functions for timeline calculations. These are the foundational math operations that all video editing operations depend on. Emphasis on correctness through property-based testing.\n\n## Context\nVideo editing requires frame-accurate timing. Floating-point arithmetic introduces cumulative errors. This theme establishes:\n- Frame-based internal representation\n- Rational frame rate handling\n- Property-tested range arithmetic\n\n## Architecture Decisions\n\n### AD-001: Internal Representation\nUse integer frame counts internally, not floating-point seconds:\n- Avoids accumulated rounding errors\n- Enables exact comparisons\n- Frame rates as rational numbers (24000/1001 not 23.976)\n\n### AD-002: Pure Functions\nAll timeline math functions are pure:\n- No side effects\n- No I/O\n- Deterministic output for given input\n- Enables exhaustive property testing\n\n### AD-003: Error Handling\nUse Result types with descriptive errors:\n- No panics in library code\n- Errors carry context for debugging\n- Validation returns all errors, not just first\n\n## Dependencies\n- Theme 1 (project-foundation) must be complete\n- proptest crate for property testing\n\n## Risks\n- Complexity of drop-frame timecode (deferred to later version)\n- Edge cases in range arithmetic\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All property tests pass\n- Round-trip conversions are exact\n- No floating-point in core calculations\n- Clippy clean"
