PROJECT=stoat-and-ferret
VERSION=v006

NOTE: Task 005 produced a single file `comms/outbox/versions/design/v006/005-logical-design/logical-design.md` which contains all the logical design content including risks and unknowns (at the bottom), test strategy references, execution order, theme/feature breakdown. The separate `risks-and-unknowns.md` and `test-strategy.md` files were not created as separate files — their content is embedded in `logical-design.md`. Read that file for all Task 005 outputs.

Output Requirements:
- Save task artifacts to comms/outbox/versions/design/v006/006-critical-thinking/ as specified in the task prompt
- Save a README.md to comms/outbox/exploration/design-v006-006-critical/ summarizing what was produced
- Commit all changes with descriptive messages
