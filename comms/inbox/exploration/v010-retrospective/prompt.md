Read the file docs/auto-dev/PROMPTS/retrospective_prompt/000-master-prompt.md and follow its instructions exactly to execute the Post-Version Retrospective for version v010.

The target version is v010 (Async Pipeline & Job Controls). Follow the master prompt to completion, executing all phases and sub-explorations it specifies.

## Output Requirements

All output files must be written to: comms/outbox/exploration/v010-retrospective/

The master prompt will define the specific output files. At minimum, produce:
- README.md summarizing what was done and key findings

Any additional files produced by the retrospective phases (backlog audits, quality reports, learnings, retrospective summaries, etc.) should also be placed in the output folder or subfolders as directed by the master prompt.

## Commit Instructions

After all work is complete, commit all changes with message: "docs: v010 post-version retrospective" and include the folder comms/outbox/exploration/v010-retrospective/ in the commit.
