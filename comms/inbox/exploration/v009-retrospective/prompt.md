## Task: Post-Version Retrospective for v009

Read and follow the instructions in `docs/auto-dev/PROMPTS/retrospective_prompt/000-master-prompt.md` to execute the Post-Version Retrospective against **version v009** of the stoat-and-ferret project.

The master prompt contains the full workflow — follow it completely. The target version is v009 (Observability & GUI Runtime).

## Output Requirements

All outputs must be saved to: `comms/outbox/exploration/v009-retrospective/`

Create a `README.md` in that folder summarizing what was produced.

## Commit Instructions

Commit all generated files with message: `docs: v009 post-version retrospective`
