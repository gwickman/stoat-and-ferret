# Glossary

Key terms and concepts used throughout the Stoat & Ferret documentation and codebase.

---

### acrossfade

An FFmpeg audio filter that creates a crossfade between two audio inputs. Supports configurable fade curves (`tri`, `qsin`, `hsin`, etc.) and overlap control. Used in Stoat & Ferret as the `acrossfade` effect type for audio transitions between clips.

### AI Theater Mode

**[Planned]** A future feature providing a specialized interface for AI-driven editing sessions with natural language commands and real-time preview.

### Clip

A reference to a portion of a source video, placed at a specific position on a project's timeline. Defined by `in_point`, `out_point`, and `timeline_position` (all in frames). Clips are non-destructive -- they do not modify the source video file.

### drawtext

An FFmpeg video filter that renders text on top of video frames. Supports configurable font, size, color, and position. Used in Stoat & Ferret as the `text_overlay` effect type.

### Effect

A processing operation applied to a clip that generates an FFmpeg filter string. Effects are non-destructive and stored as metadata on the clip. Each effect has a type, parameters, and a generated filter string.

### Effect Workshop

The interactive GUI page (`/gui/effects`) for discovering, configuring, previewing, and applying effects to clips. Composed of the Clip Selector, Effect Catalog, Effect Parameter Form, Filter Preview, and Effect Stack components.

### FFmpeg

A comprehensive open-source multimedia framework used by Stoat & Ferret for video probing (metadata extraction), thumbnail generation, and filter string execution. FFmpeg must be installed and available on `PATH` for the application to function. See [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/).

### FFmpeg filter

A processing unit within FFmpeg's filter system (e.g., `drawtext`, `fade`, `xfade`, `setpts`, `volume`). Filters are specified as strings in a specific syntax and can be chained together in a filter graph.

### Filter chain

An ordered sequence of FFmpeg filters applied to a media stream. In Stoat & Ferret, each clip's effect stack generates a filter chain that describes all processing to apply during rendering.

### Filter string

A text representation of an FFmpeg filter with its parameters (e.g., `drawtext=text='Hello':fontsize=48`). Generated by the Rust core's filter builders and stored on clips as part of their effect configuration.

### Frame

A single image in a video sequence. Stoat & Ferret uses frames as the base unit for all time coordinates (in_point, out_point, timeline_position) to ensure frame-accurate editing.

### Frame rate

The number of frames displayed per second in a video. Stored as a fraction (`frame_rate_numerator` / `frame_rate_denominator`) to support non-integer rates like 29.97 fps (30000/1001). Common values: 24 fps (film), 30 fps (NTSC video), 60 fps (high frame rate).

### Health check

An API endpoint that reports the operational status of the application. The liveness probe (`/health/live`) checks that the server is running. The readiness probe (`/health/ready`) checks database connectivity and FFmpeg availability.

### In point

The starting frame number within a source video for a clip. Specifies where playback begins in the source material. Measured in frames (not seconds). Must be >= 0.

### Maturin

A build tool for compiling Rust code into Python extension modules via PyO3. Used to build the `stoat_ferret_core` package, which provides frame-accurate timeline math, clip validation, and FFmpeg filter builders. See [maturin-rs.github.io](https://www.maturin.rs/).

### Non-destructive editing

An editing approach where source media files are never modified. All edits (clip selections, effects, transitions) are stored as metadata and applied only during rendering. This allows unlimited undo/redo and preserves the original footage.

### Out point

The ending frame number within a source video for a clip. Specifies where playback ends in the source material. Measured in frames (not seconds). Must be >= 0 and must not exceed the source video's `duration_frames`.

### Prometheus metrics

Operational metrics exposed at the `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus text format. Includes HTTP request counts, response latencies, effect application counts, and transition application counts. Used for monitoring and observability.

### PyO3

A Rust crate that provides bindings between Rust and Python. Stoat & Ferret uses PyO3 to expose the Rust core (filter builders, clip validation, timeline math) as a Python extension module (`stoat_ferret_core`). See [pyo3.rs](https://pyo3.rs/).

### Render job

**[Planned]** An asynchronous task that assembles a project's timeline into a final output video file by applying all clips, effects, and transitions using FFmpeg.

### Rust core

The `stoat_ferret_core` package, written in Rust and exposed to Python via PyO3. Provides high-performance, type-safe implementations of FFmpeg filter builders (`DrawtextBuilder`, `FadeBuilder`, `XfadeBuilder`, etc.), clip validation, and timeline arithmetic.

### Timeline

The ordered arrangement of clips within a project. Each clip has a `timeline_position` (in frames) that determines where it appears. The timeline defines the structure of the final output video.

### Timeline position

The frame number on the project timeline where a clip starts. Determines the clip's placement relative to other clips. Measured in frames (not seconds). Must be >= 0.

### WebSocket

A bidirectional communication protocol used by Stoat & Ferret to push real-time events to connected clients. The WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`) sends heartbeat messages and event notifications (scan progress, project creation, etc.).

### xfade

An FFmpeg video filter that creates a crossfade transition between two video inputs. Supports 59 transition types (fade, dissolve, wipeleft, circleopen, etc.) with configurable duration and offset. Used in Stoat & Ferret as the `xfade` effect type for video transitions between clips.
