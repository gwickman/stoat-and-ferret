Investigation (pr001-webfetch-breakdown) found only 5 of 14 belong to stoat-and-ferret (v002: 2, v006: 3). The remaining 9 were cross-project contamination (kb-store 4, auto-dev-mcp 4, gw-test 1) due to health check querying with scope=all. Impact was low \u2014 sessions were killed quickly. Root cause: WebFetch has no timeout + agents fetch URLs that won't return (GitHub pages, auth-walled sites). Addressed globally by auto-dev-mcp BL-536.",

      "description": "34 unique orphaned tool calls (tool_use without tool_result) across 7 tool types: Bash (11), TaskOutput (8), Task (7), Read (6), Edit (1), Grep (1), Write (1). Investigation (pr002-orphaned-tools-breakdown) found only 4 of 28 affected sessions belong to stoat-and-ferret. 69% of orphans are blocking waits (sleep commands, TaskOutput polling, pytest runs) \u2014 normal session termination during long operations. Zero correlation with WebFetch orphans (PR-001), confirming independent causes. Lost work risk minimal: 33 of 35 orphans are non-destructive; only 1 Edit and 1 Write on non-production files carry moderate risk. Also flagged 3x row inflation from duplicate tool_use_ids in the ingestion pipeline. No action required for data integrity \u2014 these represent normal session lifecycle patterns.",

      "description": "27 sessions triggered 3+ context compaction events, with the worst hitting 16 compactions in a single session. Top 5 sessions: 16, 12, 12, 10, 10 compaction events. This indicates sessions routinely exhausting their context windows, risking loss of implementation context and partial work. Possible causes include large codebase reads filling context, verbose tool results, or sessions that run too long without natural boundaries. Remediation options: (1) investigate top-compacting sessions to identify what fills context (2) consider prompt patterns that reduce context consumption (3) evaluate whether task decomposition into smaller sessions would help (4) explore pre-compaction checkpointing to preserve critical state.",

      "description": "Session analytics across v006-v010 show the Edit tool has an 11.7% error rate (126 errors out of 1,074 calls). This is the second-highest error rate among core file operation tools (after WebFetch at 58.3%). LRN-038 (v007) documented that sub-agents frequently fail with \"file not read\" errors when attempting Write/Edit without prior Read calls. Despite this learning being captured, the Edit error rate remains elevated, suggesting the learning has not been effectively applied across all sub-agent prompt templates.\n\n**Evidence:**\n- Edit tool: 1,074 calls, 126 errors (11.7%)\n- Write tool: 1,468 calls, 15 errors (1.0%) \u2014 demonstrates the gap is Edit-specific\n- LRN-038 captured in v007, but errors persist through v008-v010\n- Pattern is consistent with \"file not read\" failures across multiple sub-agent sessions\n\n**Suggested action:** Audit sub-agent prompt templates to ensure all Edit operations are preceded by Read calls. Consider adding a pre-check validation or prompt pattern that enforces read-before-edit ordering.",

      "description": "Session analytics across v006-v010 show WebFetch has a 58.3% error rate (28 errors out of 48 calls). This is by far the highest error rate of any tool. PR-001 (completed) investigated orphaned WebFetch calls specifically, but the error rate itself persists. Each failed WebFetch call wastes an API round-trip and contributes to context consumption.\n\n**Evidence:**\n- WebFetch: 48 calls, 28 errors (58.3%) across the v006-v010 period\n- PR-001 (completed) noted WebFetch has no timeout and agents fetch URLs that won't return\n- LRN-038 (v007) and PR-002 addressed related orphaned call patterns\n- deepwiki ask_question also shows 21.4% error rate (6 of 28 calls), suggesting external API reliability issues compound the problem\n\n**Suggested action:** Add guardrails to sub-agent prompts discouraging WebFetch for auth-walled or unreliable URLs. Consider implementing a URL allowlist or pre-check pattern to avoid known-failing domains.",

      "description": "C4 architecture documentation has been falling behind implementation across v009 and v010, accumulating 16 drift items in BL-069. Despite LRN-030 (v006) establishing that architecture documentation should be an explicit feature deliverable, and v006 demonstrating this successfully with a dedicated documentation feature, v009 and v010 did not include architecture documentation features. The drift is growing version-over-version.\n\n**Evidence:**\n- v006: C4 docs updated within the version as a dedicated feature (LRN-030)\n- v007: C4 docs regenerated in delta mode post-version, no drift\n- v008: C4 docs regenerated in delta mode, no drift\n- v009: 5 C4 drift items identified, BL-069 created\n- v010: 11 additional drift items, BL-069 now at 16 total items\n- LRN-030 explicitly recommends a documentation feature per theme \u2014 pattern abandoned after v007\n\n**Suggested action:** Re-establish the dedicated architecture documentation feature pattern from v006/v007. BL-069 should be scheduled as a high-priority item in the next version before drift compounds further.",

It was listed as an outstanding item in v006's and v007's backlog reports.
