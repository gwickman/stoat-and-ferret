Investigation (pr001-webfetch-breakdown) found only 5 of 14 belong to stoat-and-ferret (v002: 2, v006: 3). The remaining 9 were cross-project contamination (kb-store 4, auto-dev-mcp 4, gw-test 1) due to health check querying with scope=all. Impact was low \u2014 sessions were killed quickly. Root cause: WebFetch has no timeout + agents fetch URLs that won't return (GitHub pages, auth-walled sites). Addressed globally by auto-dev-mcp BL-536.",

      "description": "34 unique orphaned tool calls (tool_use without tool_result) across 7 tool types: Bash (11), TaskOutput (8), Task (7), Read (6), Edit (1), Grep (1), Write (1). Investigation (pr002-orphaned-tools-breakdown) found only 4 of 28 affected sessions belong to stoat-and-ferret. 69% of orphans are blocking waits (sleep commands, TaskOutput polling, pytest runs) \u2014 normal session termination during long operations. Zero correlation with WebFetch orphans (PR-001), confirming independent causes. Lost work risk minimal: 33 of 35 orphans are non-destructive; only 1 Edit and 1 Write on non-production files carry moderate risk. Also flagged 3x row inflation from duplicate tool_use_ids in the ingestion pipeline. No action required for data integrity \u2014 these represent normal session lifecycle patterns.",

      "title": "Session health: Excessive context compaction across 27 sessions",
      "description": "27 sessions triggered 3+ context compaction events, with the worst hitting 16 compactions in a single session. Top 5 sessions: 16, 12, 12, 10, 10 compaction events. This indicates sessions routinely exhausting their context windows, risking loss of implementation context and partial work. Possible causes include large codebase reads filling context, verbose tool results, or sessions that run too long without natural boundaries. Remediation options: (1) investigate top-compacting sessions to identify what fills context (2) consider prompt patterns that reduce context consumption (3) evaluate whether task decomposition into smaller sessions would help (4) explore pre-compaction checkpointing to preserve critical state.",
