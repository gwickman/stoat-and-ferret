## Deferred Items

| Item | From | To | Rationale |
|------|------|----|-----------|
| Contract tests with real FFmpeg | M1.3 | v004 | Part of testing infrastructure version |
| Drop-frame timecode support | M1.2 | TBD | Complex; start with non-drop-frame only |

## Backlog Integration

Work categories:

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `investigation` | Needs exploration before implementation |
| `deferred` | Known work explicitly pushed to later |
| `discovered` | Found during execution, not originally planned |
| `blocked` | Waiting on external dependency |

**Version-agnostic items** (can be addressed opportunistically):
- BL-011 (P3): Consolidate Python/Rust build backends
- BL-018 (P2): Create C4 architecture documentation
- BL-019 (P1): Add Windows bash /dev/null guidance to AGENTS.md
